                                Cyber-attacks on communication networks involve unauthorized digital intrusions into
                                systems that support communicationâ€”such as email servers, mobile networks, satellite
                                links, and internet infrastructure. These attacks can steal, alter, disrupt, or destroy
                                information. Targets often include government networks, military command systems,
                                financial institutions, and media platforms. <br><br>Ukraine (2022â€“Present):
                                Russiaâ€™s invasion included major cyber-attacks on satellite and internet systems, aiming
                                to disable communication. <br><br>North Korea: Accused of repeated cyber intrusions
                                against South Korean infrastructure and international targets, including cryptocurrency
                                exchanges. <br><br> Cyber capabilities are now a core pillar of national security.
                                Governments and militaries use them to:

                                Detect and prevent attacks in real-time

                                Disrupt enemy communications or infrastructure without deploying physical forces

                                Secure critical systems, such as air defense networks, military satellites, and
                                logistics operations

                                For example, the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) was established to conduct both
                                defensive and offensive cyber operations, integrating cyber with traditional military
                                strategy. <br><br> Cyber tools allow for covert monitoring of hostile actors by
                                infiltrating their digital communications:

                                Tracking troop movements via intercepted data

                                Monitoring diplomatic or military discussions

                                Collecting metadata to map terrorist networks

                                Example: Israeli intelligence used cyber surveillance to uncover and preempt terror
                                plots by monitoring encrypted messaging platforms. <br><br> The demand for cyber
                                resilience is driving major technological innovation:

                                AI and machine learning are used to detect and respond to threats faster than human
                                analysts

                                Quantum encryption is being explored for ultra-secure communication

                                Startups and governments are developing next-gen firewalls, behavioral monitoring
                                systems, and autonomous cyber agents

                                This has created new industries, career paths, and research opportunities in digital
                                defense.
