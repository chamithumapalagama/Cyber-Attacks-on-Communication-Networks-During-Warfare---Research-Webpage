                                beyond physical terrain into the digital realm. Technology plays a defining role in how
                                conflicts are initiated, managed, and resolved—shaping not only military doctrine but
                                also societal resilience. From precision-guided munitions to advanced cyber operations,
                                modern warfare is increasingly characterized by its reliance on digital infrastructure.
                                As the distinction between physical and virtual attacks continues to blur, it is
                                imperative to understand the transformative impact of emerging technologies on both
                                national security and civilian life.

                            <p class="lead text-secondary">One of the most critical—and vulnerable—elements of modern
                                conflict is communication. Cyber-attacks targeting communication networks, including
                                satellites, internet infrastructure, and military command systems, have emerged as
                                strategic tools used to disrupt, degrade, and dominate. For example, during the 2022
                                Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Viasat satellite attack disabled internet access for
                                thousands across Europe, impacting not only military operations but also civilian
                                systems such as energy infrastructure
                                . Similarly, state-sponsored campaigns from actors like North Korea have leveraged cyber
                                capabilities to infiltrate secure communications and exfiltrate sensitive defense
                                information
                                . These incidents underscore a critical truth: in the era of digital warfare, control
                                over communication is synonymous with control over the conflict itself.</p>
